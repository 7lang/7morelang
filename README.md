# Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks

This repository contains the code examples for
[Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/titles/7lang)
by Bruce A. Tate, Fred Daoud, Jack Moffitt, and Ian Dees. In the book,
we take you on a step-by-step journey through Lua, Factor, Elixir,
Elm, Julia, MiniKanren, and Idris.

Some of these languages are evolving rapidly; should you find a code
example that needs to be tweaked to work with the latest version of a
language, please send us a pull request!

You can also fork this repository and use it to try your hand at the
exercises in the book; we've provided an `exercises` directory for this
purpose.
